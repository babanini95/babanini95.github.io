Hi, my name is Abdullah Robbani and you can call me Bani. Welcome to my blog ðŸ‘‹.

## What I Do

I studied **mechanical engineering** for over six years, but I ended up in **programming** quite accidentally. For the past three years, I've been involved in many **Unity projects**, ranging from 2D and 3D to single-player, multi-player, and even blockchain-integrated applications. Currently, I'm focused on sharpening my skills in **backend development with Go**.

Outside of programming, my wife and I are starting an **eyewear shop** called **Gaze & Co**.
